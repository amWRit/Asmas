<p>These are the basic things you should do before using other functions of the program.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		First add a Year, possibly the current year.
	</li>

	<li>
		Then add a School for that year.
	</li>

	<li>
		Then add USERS. 
		<p>
			Users are basically the teachers in your school. Users can be an admin, class teacher or a viewer. If you want to create a user that can only view the database, create a user with role 'viewer'.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		Now create Classes.
		<p>
			You can choose the class teacher of the class based on users you just created.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		Now CREATE students.
	</li>

	<li>
		You have now created the basic database.
