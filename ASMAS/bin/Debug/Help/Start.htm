<p> Go to Admin Tools menu and do the following.. </p>

<ol>
	<li>

	</li>

	<li>

	</li>

	<li>
		Then add USERS.

			Users are basically the teachers in your school. Users can be an admin, class teacher or a viewer. If you want to create a user that can only view the database, create a user with role 'viewer'.
		</p>
	</li>
