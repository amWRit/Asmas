<p>You are the ADMIN.</p>

<p>These are the basic things you should do before using other functions of the program.</p>

<p>First add a Year, possibly the current year.</p>

<p>Then add a School for that year.</p>

<p>Then add USERS. Users are basically the teachers in your school. Users can be an admin, class teacher or a viewer. If you want to create a user that can only view the database, create a user with role 'viewer'.</p>

<p>Now create Classes, where you can choose the class teacher of the class based on users you just created.</p>

<p>Now CREATE students.</p>

<p>You have now created the basic database.</p>
